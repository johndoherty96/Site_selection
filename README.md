<h1>Optimizing Vineyard Locations in California Using GIS Tools</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we focus on the lucrative agricultural industry of grape cultivation and wine production in California, which ranks 6th globally for optimal wine-growing climate, generating over $88 billion in 2022. Given the temperamental nature of wine grapes, which require specific conditions to thrive, we utilize agricultural data such as soil conditions, hydrology, and elevation to identify optimal vineyard locations in a specified California valley. Using GIS analysis tools, we convert vector data into raster data to evaluate and determine the best growing conditions. Core objectives include understanding continuous and discrete data, creating hillshade and aspect layers from elevation data, interpolating continuous surfaces from sample points, reclassifying continuous surfaces into discrete categories, and conducting distance and map algebra calculations to ensure the success of the site selection process.
